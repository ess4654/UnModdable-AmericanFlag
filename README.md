Game development will never be the same with open source model of an American flag using vertex colors over texture mapping.
Anyone is free to use this model in your commercially licensed games where you plaster the walls with it to offend the Radical Left and war loving hypocrites. Screaming MAGA till their brains explode!
Texture swapping hackers will suffer for their efforts from now on!
